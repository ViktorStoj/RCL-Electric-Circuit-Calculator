# RCL-Electric-Circuit-Calculator
 
        The program reads EE_Data.txt to receive any past data. The user is prompted to use previous data or input their own.

        If user uses previous data, selected data with be used to plot function q(t) (Charge over Time).

        If user chooses to input their own data, they input: L, C, the battery voltage, the dissipation time td,
    and the percent of original charge pc to reach within dissipation time into the program when prompted.

        The program, using the bisection method, calculates the root R and displays it to the user. The
    program will plot q(t) (Charge over Time) with the newly acquired data.

        The user will be prompted to store data into the file EE_Data.txt. If a data slot is available,
    they may save it there. Otherwise, they will be prompted to replace an existing data slot.
